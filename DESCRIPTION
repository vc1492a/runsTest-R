Description: An implementation of the runs test (Wald-Wolfowitz test) in R.
    Accepts a linear regression model as input and tests whether autocorrelation
    is present in the residuals, which is useful for time series models. The
    result of the test displays the expected runs, the actual number of runs, and
    whether autocorrelation is likely.
